Let me analyze the project structure to locate the backend code and TypeScript files. I'll start by examining the project directory.

Analyzed
c:\Users\Amar\Downloads\PortfolioBuilder (2)
Let me explore the PortfolioBuilder directory to find the backend code and TypeScript files.

Analyzed
c:\Users\Amar\Downloads\PortfolioBuilder (2)\PortfolioBuilder
Let me check the server directory first, as it likely contains the backend code, and then I'll look at the client directory for TypeScript files.

1. Backend Code Analysis
Let's examine the server directory:

Analyzed
c:\Users\Amar\Downloads\PortfolioBuilder (2)\PortfolioBuilder\server
2. TypeScript Presence
Let's check the client directory for TypeScript files:

Analyzed
c:\Users\Amar\Downloads\PortfolioBuilder (2)\PortfolioBuilder\client
Let me check the source directory for TypeScript files to get a complete picture of the project structure and its components.

Project Analysis: Backend and TypeScript
1. Backend Code
Location: 
server/
 directory

Key Files:

app.ts
 - Main Express.js application setup
index-dev.ts
 - Development server entry point
index-prod.ts
 - Production server entry point
routes.ts
 - API route definitions
storage.ts
 - File storage configuration
Purpose: The backend is built with Node.js/Express.js and handles:

API endpoints for portfolio data
File uploads and management
Environment-specific configurations (dev/prod)
Database interactions (Drizzle ORM)
2. TypeScript Usage
Main Locations:

Frontend (
client/
 directory):
src/
 - Main application code
App.tsx
 - Root React component
main.tsx
 - Application entry point
components/
 - Reusable UI components
pages/
 - Page components
types/
 - TypeScript type definitions
hooks/
 - Custom React hooks
lib/
 - Utility functions
Configuration:
tsconfig.json
 - TypeScript configuration
vite.config.ts
 - Vite build tool configuration
drizzle.config.ts
 - Database ORM configuration
TypeScript Features:

Strong typing throughout the application
React components written in TypeScript (.tsx)
Type definitions for API responses and data models
Modern JavaScript/TypeScript features (ES modules, async/await, etc.)
This is a full-stack TypeScript application with a clear separation between frontend and backend concerns. The backend serves as an API layer, while the frontend is a modern React application built with TypeScript for type safety.
